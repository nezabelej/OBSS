-----------INSTRUCTIONS----------
To fully complete the assignment you have to satisfy following requirements: The QRS detector has to accept the name of the record (.dat and .hea files of the database) as a parameter. The program has to open this record and detect the QRS complexes in the record. The program has to write an annotation file (.det) in the ASCII format, which contains sample indexes of the fiducial points (FPs) of the detected QRS complexes. The performance of the program has to be evaluated in the sense of sensitivity (Se) and positive predictivity (+P) with regard to manually annotated fiducial points (FPs) of the QRS complexes (.atr files of the database). The results of the performance evaluation together with your discussions and conclusions have to be written into another text (.txt) file. Discuss also the weaknesses of the implemented technique and possible improvements. The .det and .txt files, together with source of your program (included in a single compressed .zip archive) have to be submitted during uploading the assignment.

-----------SOLUTION-------------

1. Our program accepts the name of the record (.dat and .hea files of the database) as a parameter. 

2. High-pass filter
HPF suppresses the low-frequency waves and accentuates the QRS complex. We use the equations, used in the reference article.

3. Low-pass filter
LPF performs a non-linear amplification and full-wave rectification. We set the window size with which we slide through our graph and square and sum the points inside the current window. With squaring, we amplify the QRS wave, and also we suppress the noise (because 0.1^2 = 0.01). Squaring also takes care of losing the negative values.

4. Decision making
We find the first peak in the graph. With this one, we compute the first threshold with the equation: threshold = alfa * gamma * peak + (1 - alpha) * threshold. Then we iterate through all the points and seek for the peaks (if peak > threshold). When finding them, we save them and update the threshold.

5. Outputing the .det file with QRS detections.
Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)  ...The proportion of events which were detected.
Positive predictivity = TP / (TP + FP) ...The proportion of detections which actually were events.

-----------CONCLUSION------------

The algorithm despite its simplicity brings very good results. Results also depend on the parameters' values.

HOW TO:
1. Convert .dat to .mat: wfdb2mat -r 100

2. Convert .det to .qrs: wrann -r 100 -a qrs < 100.det

3. Compare the results with referential results: bxb -r 100 -a atr qrs
